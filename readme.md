# 🐦 Bluebird OS

Bluebird OS is a web-based experimental operating system built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It is designed to run like a lightweight OS environment inside a browser or Android app, capable of launching apps, managing windows, and acting as a mobile launcher.

This project is developed by Norbert Lamn as part of research into alternative operating systems, secure web apps, and controlled digital communities.
